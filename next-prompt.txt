Let's now do one more thing.
Let's get rid of the build command
instead we will create a cargo-pvm-contract-builder crate that will build the contract for us
and we will generate the contracts with a build.rs file that reference it.

this way user can simply run 

cargo pvm-contract  to generate their contract (instead of calling cargo pvm-contract init)

and they can just do 


cargo build to build their contract to PVM like any regular crate
